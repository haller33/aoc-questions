Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 16: Ticket Translation ---</h2><p>As you're walking to yet another connecting flight, you realize that one of the legs of your re-routed trip coming up is on a high-speed train. However, the train ticket you were given is in a language you don't understand. You should probably figure out what it says before you get to the train station after the next flight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you <span title="This actually happened to me once, but I solved it by just asking someone.">can't actually <em>read</em> the words on the ticket</span>. You can, however, read the numbers, and so you figure out <em>the fields these tickets must have</em> and <em>the valid ranges</em> for values in those fields.</p>
<p>You collect the <em>rules for ticket fields</em>, the <em>numbers on your ticket</em>, and the <em>numbers on other nearby tickets</em> for the same train service (via the airport security cameras) together into a single document you can reference (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>The <em>rules for ticket fields</em> specify a list of fields that exist <em>somewhere</em> on the ticket and the <em>valid ranges of values</em> for each field. For example, a rule like <code>class: 1-3 or 5-7</code> means that one of the fields in every ticket is named <code>class</code> and can be any value in the ranges <code>1-3</code> or <code>5-7</code> (inclusive, such that <code>3</code> and <code>5</code> are both valid in this field, but <code>4</code> is not).</p>
<p>Each ticket is represented by a single line of comma-separated values. The values are the numbers on the ticket in the order they appear; every ticket has the same format. For example, consider this ticket:</p>
<pre><code>.--------------------------------------------------------.
| ????: 101    ?????: 102   ??????????: 103     ???: 104 |
|                                                        |
| ??: 301  ??: 302             ???????: 303      ??????? |
| ??: 401  ??: 402           ???? ????: 403    ????????? |
'--------------------------------------------------------'
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>?</code> represents text in a language you don't understand. This ticket might be represented as <code>101,102,103,104,301,302,303,401,402,403</code>; of course, the actual train tickets you're looking at are <em>much</em> more complicated. In any case, you've extracted just the numbers in such a way that the first number is always the same specific field, the second number is always a different specific field, and so on - you just don't know what each position actually means!</p>
<p>Start by determining which tickets are <em>completely invalid</em>; these are tickets that contain values which <em>aren't valid for any field</em>. Ignore <em>your ticket</em> for now.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have the following notes:</p>
<pre><code>class: 1-3 or 5-7
row: 6-11 or 33-44
seat: 13-40 or 45-50

your ticket:
7,1,14

nearby tickets:
7,3,47
40,<em>4</em>,50
<em>55</em>,2,20
38,6,<em>12</em>
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't matter which position corresponds to which field; you can identify invalid <em>nearby tickets</em> by considering only whether tickets contain <em>values that are not valid for any field</em>. In this example, the values on the first <em>nearby ticket</em> are all valid for at least one field. This is not true of the other three <em>nearby tickets</em>: the values <code>4</code>, <code>55</code>, and <code>12</code> are are not valid for any field. Adding together all of the invalid values produces your <em>ticket scanning error rate</em>: <code>4 + 55 + 12</code> = <em><code>71</code></em>.</p>
<p>Consider the validity of the <em>nearby tickets</em> you scanned. <em>What is your ticket scanning error rate?</em></p>
